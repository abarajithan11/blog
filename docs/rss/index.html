They approach HDLs with the software programming mindset. In addition, our program does not teach an HDL explicitly but expects students to pick up from Verilog basics and learn as they go. As a result, many are unaware of the advanced features of SystemVerilog that makes their lives easy by reducing bugs and saving time.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/Slide35.PNG" class="kg-image" alt="Webinar Series: RTL Design and Simulation with SystemVerilog (slides, recordings and feedback)" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/Slide35.PNG 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/Slide35.PNG 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/Slide35.PNG 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Examples, topics and features covered</figcaption></figure><p>During my undergraduate project, I used SystemVerilog for features such as multidimensional ports.

Thank you so much for sharing those details with me. I loved your first and second sessions. But couldn&apos;t join for the third one due to my busy schedule. I enjoyed the session on system verilog you conducted today very much. Is it possible to share a list containing the books and videos I can read and watch to learn system verilog from the scratch? Thank you for the session again. It was pretty awesome and interesting. </li><li>What I feel is that this session was the cream of the HDL extracted from internet and every references. If you can do this kind of dedications, it would really helpful for the new comers to the field. Thank you vary much aiya and all the best for your future works! &lt;3</li><li>This was very good. I had almost 0 experience in this, just the semester 3 practical. As a beginner I leant a lot. Thank you very much. The speed was alright, almost nothing to complain about. Thank you once again.</li><li>I loved the session. It was amazing how the session covered a lot of content within such a short period of time while concentrating on the basics as well. Thank you for such a helpful session. In the session, the presenter asked us to write code before explaining the code. It will be better if the code was explained a bit before at least what the code does in chunks and asked us to write the code, it will be better. I would like to know proper resources where we can refer with respect to SystemVerilog, so that whenever we have a knowledge gap we will know where to refer to.</li><li>The session was excellent. I have done digital circuit designs using Verilog before. But, I did not have a clear understanding on most of the stuff. Today, I could understand many of them with your step by step explanations. Thanks a lot for that. The method of delivery was fine to me. Definitely I will join for the next sessions as well. Thank you again for conducting such a fruitful session.</li><li>I&apos;m an NDES diploma holder from IET Katunayaka. This field is only heard by me during our training sessions and never been taught to us during our academic sessions. This lecture series is very valuable for us and thank you very much for open knowledge sharing and providing recorded zoom videos. Your teaching style is very attractive and not boring. I wish you all the best and hope you will continue to share your valuable knowledge with the local technologically curious audience. Please make sure to give more publicity to theses sessions since I got the email only from a good friend of mine.</li><li>excellent session. nice visuals. clear explanations. speed was adequate so that students can grasp the idea. looking forward for advanced stuff. thank you</li><li>session 4 was very interesting with the matrix multiplication part. It would be very useful if you can add more applications if possible. Thank you for your time for doing all these useful sessions and hope to see more of these in future.</li><li>Sessions series was really helpful and I think, it made it easy to go deeper into the system Verilog HDL since now we know what are the limitations and capabilities of the language. It would be better if the speaker can go more slowly. As it is really difficult to move between zoom and the application software when he is explaining things. Giving some time after explanation to make things clear will be better and more productive.</li><li>Nothing big to complain. Never felt other sessions like these, this much interactive and useful. Thank you for all your effort</li><li>3rd session also was very much informative and anyone with a basic knowledge could follow. It was bit fast but was manageable as I have some prior experience with verilog coding. You covered a big area with that limited time and keep it going for more sessions in the future for other key topics as well. Thanks</li><li>The Session was okay, some of them were very advance, but it is interesting to learn. Thank you for doing this.</li><li>Thank you very much sir once again. I learnt a lot today and could get the answers for many problems that I had up to now. Thanks once again...!!!</li><li>The session was comprehensive and clear. Within the time constraint, a better insight to the subject is provided. Thank you for your hard work.</li><li>Thank you very much sir. This is extremely helpful for me. I have met some of these issues that you spoke about today and didn&apos;t know how to overcome those ones and now I understand how to solve those problems. Thank you very much once again...!!!</li><li>fruitful session. nice visuals. thank you so much. My suggestion is it is better to have the final project in a separate session. I guess there will be a lot to cover. this is the adequate speed to maintain. definitely, we may not be able to cover the last 3 in 2 hours. thank you</li><li>good explanation and you answered our questions clearly. appreciate it</li><li>Very much informative, clear and interactive. Appreciate your sharp and broad knowledge on the subject</li><li>Hopeful for more sessions like this in future too</li><li>Thank you for conducting this session. It was really helpful in understanding the basics of digital designs.</li><li>The session was really really good. This makes to get into academic projects very easy. The pace of the session was also good. I would like to know more about vivado and systemverilog that will help me to do advanced projects. Hope you cover much much more in coming sessions. If possible it would be great to cover industrial aspects as well while designing and implementing.</li><li>one kindly request sir....only if you can, keep the sessions like this further with the whole ENTC junior staff, because these are very useful</li><li>Good work Anna... Our department can use this quarantine time to this kind of activities. ENTC can support more for this kind of tutorials. For a geek like me , It is very helpful. I have to spend a lot of time in finding good tutorials. Don&apos;t stop with 3 sessions. Expecting more Anna.</li><li>Nice interaction. Helped me to recall what I leaned in digital IC designing.</li><li>Well done mlli!!! Superb! nd thnx a lot for ur generous service!You had worked hard on it! You must be full contented abt ur effort mlli!!!it was truly amazing</li></ul><p></p><h2 id="code">Code</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/abarajithan11/entc_missing_semester/tree/master/systemverilog">github.com/abarajithan11/entc_missing_semester/tree/master/systemverilog</a></p><h2 id="video-recordings">Video Recordings</h2><p>First video was downloaded 2279 times (and counting)</p><p>Download: <a href="https://dms.uom.lk/s/VMVBDESqhc7ByZv">dms.uom.lk/s/VMVBDESqhc7ByZv</a></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ol><li><strong>RTL Modeling with SystemVerilog for Simulation and Synthesis: Using SystemVerilog for ASIC and FPGA Design</strong> by Stuart Sutherland&#x200B;<br>Primary reference material I used for the slides.

ABRUTECH is a unique custom processor highly optimized to manipulate matrices while preserving the functionalities of a generic processor. It has been designed to strike the delicate balance in the above tradeoffs. While having only 16 instructions, the ISA of ABRUTECH is crafted to be simple, yet highly powerful and is implemented using only 1000 logic elements.</p><p>This is demonstrated in the results section, with sample programs that are only 30-40 bytes long but are able to downsample and upsample any 512x512 image by any integer, detect edges, find prime numbers and Fibonacci numbers. . . etc.</p><h2 id="instruction-set-architecture-isa">Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)</h2><p>With only 16 instructions each of which execute in only 2.2 clocks cycles on average, our ISA and the complier allow the programmer to write programs quickly that take only 1.8 bytes of memory per instruction on average. Our ISA was designed to incorporate advantageous features from both RISC and CISC instruction sets. As in RISC, each operation is designed to perform a specific task, especially the load and store operations are maintained strictly separate. However, unlike RISC, not all instructions are of equal length but are either 1, 2 or 4 bytes long. Certain instructions are encoded, resulting in high code density. This allows building smaller programs that use the limited instruction memory efficiently while also allowing faster execution. However, this is balanced with maintaining moderate hardware-level complexity in our system architecture.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/isa-1.png" width="710" height="1380" loading="lazy" alt="Custom Processor (Verilog), ISA, Compiler &amp; Simulator (Python)" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/isa-1.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/isa-1.png 710w"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/Register_Set.png" width="636" height="864" loading="lazy" alt="Custom Processor (Verilog), ISA, Compiler &amp; Simulator (Python)" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/Register_Set.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/Register_Set.png 636w"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/u-ins-1.png" width="661" height="1341" loading="lazy" alt="Custom Processor (Verilog), ISA, Compiler &amp; Simulator (Python)" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/u-ins-1.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/u-ins-1.png 661w"></div></div></div><figcaption>ISA --- Register &#x2014; Micro instructions</figcaption></figure><h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2><p>ABRUTECH works with an 8-bit wide, 262144-bit (512x512) deep data memory and an 8-bit wide 256-bit deep instruction memory, both of which can be loaded through UART. The system was coded in Verilog HDL using Intel Quartus II Prime and implemented successfully on an Altera de2-115 development board.</p><p>While being an 8-bit processor, (bus sizes and most register sizes being 8-bit), ABRUTECH features a 12-bit ALU and accumulator, which allows it to process calculations with intermediate steps that give results up to 4096, without causing an overflow error. The ALU is also designed to perform round-o divisions (unlike the typical our division), to improve accuracy.</p><p>Our processor also features a special module called Address Maker, which (optionally) allows the programmer to navigate a 512 x 512 matrix either row-wise or column-wise, without the need of a complex algorithm. This helps in implementing image processing algorithms such as downsampling, nearest neighbour upsampling, upsampling by bilinear interpolation.</p><p>Another special feature in ABRUTECH is a bank of shift registers, which help to perform linear convolution operations several times faster. Together with Address Maker, this allows the programmer to perform 2D convolution with a linearly decomposable kernel, such as Gaussian smoothing or edge detection, without losing a row and a column of data in the process, as with the traditional algorithms.</p><h2 id="compiler-simulator-in-python-aba">Compiler &amp; Simulator in Python (Aba)</h2><p>I also built a corresponding python-based compiler program, which scans the excel sheet where ISA is specified and translates the algorithm written in the human language to an array of binary values, which are then sent to the instruction memory through UART. The compiler identifies syntax errors, which allows the programmer to write assembly code with ease, using our ISA.</p><p>In addition to the compiler, I built a simulator software for ABRUTECH. The simulator can run the algorithm like the processor and show the values of registers and memory at each step, helping us debug an algorithm fast and remotely, without repeatedly loading it into the processor.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/4_Program.png" width="633" height="375" loading="lazy" alt="Custom Processor (Verilog), ISA, Compiler &amp;

Implemented at 50 MHz on Xilinx Z706.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/Figure-7---system_diagram.png" width="751" height="633" loading="lazy" alt="Vision-Based Adaptive Traffic Control on PSoC (ARM+FPGA) [2019]" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/Figure-7---system_diagram.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/Figure-7---system_diagram.png 751w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/Figure-8---conv_unit.png" width="692" height="472" loading="lazy" alt="Vision-Based Adaptive Traffic Control on PSoC (ARM+FPGA) [2019]" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/Figure-8---conv_unit.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2021/11/Figure-8---conv_unit.png 692w"></div></div></div><figcaption>System Design on ZYNQ Programmable SoC (left); One of the 192 cores, able to do 3x3 and 1x1 convolutions (right)</figcaption></figure><h3 id="3-tracking-algorithm-aba">3.
