In fact, our department encourages students to make assignments and reports in LaTeX from the sophomore level. Through countless such submissions, I have tried multiple workflows: TexMaker, Overleaf, VSCode + Latex Workshop and more.</p><p>This year, I began writing my first paper (Kraken), targeting a journal. Since it was on my personal, passion project, wrote the entire paper, drew all diagrams, made all figures and revised it several times, before handing it over to my advisor, who reviewed it. Because this is my first paper, I wanted everything: the diagrams, graphs, their text styles and all to be perfect. I experimented and learned a lot on the way to craft my own workflow for this and my future publications.</p><p>In a nutshell,</p><ul><li>I draw diagrams with Inkscape, save them as EPS (without text) + TEX (text only), such that text is rendered in latex for a uniform style. </li><li>I use the python ecosystem to handle data. Pandas for spreadsheets, Matplotlib and Seaborn for beautiful plots. SciencePlots to conform to IEEE style.</li><li>I manage my references with Mendeley, sync them across my devices. I use Resilo to sync my handwritten notes on papers between my tablet and laptop</li><li>I write pure LaTeX with VSCode + LaTeX workshop, compile it with MiKTeX, version control everything with git and sync it to overleaf via GitHub for my supervisor.</li></ul><h2 id="drawingsinkscape">Drawings - Inkscape</h2><p>Which one looks better?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/2021/11/Figure-8---conv_unit--2--1.png" width="692" height="472" loading="lazy" alt="My Paper-Writing Workflow [Inkscape, Python, Mendeley, VSCode, Git]" srcset="https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/Figure-8---conv_unit--2--1.png 600w, https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/2021/11/Figure-8---conv_unit--2--1.png 692w"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/2021/11/kraken-1.png" width="1291" height="868" loading="lazy" alt="My Paper-Writing Workflow [Inkscape, Python, Mendeley, VSCode, Git]" srcset="https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/kraken-1.png 600w, https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/kraken-1.png 1000w, https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/2021/11/kraken-1.png 1291w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption>LEFT: one I drew with draw.io for our patent, RIGHT: one I drew with Inkscape for my paper</figcaption></figure><p>Tools like <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/">draw.io</a> lack precision. Also, the size and style of their fonts do not match the rest of the LaTeX text. Inkscape <a href="https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.1.1/">[get]</a> is a professional vector graphics tool, a fully-functional, lightweight, free and open-source alternative to Adobe Illustrator. Therefore, I learnt it to draw the two diagrams in the paper. </p><p>First, find the column/text width of your LaTeX document with <strong>\the\columnwidth</strong><em> </em>in points (1 pt = 1/72.27 inch)<em>.</em> Then set the Inkscape canvas size in <em>File &gt; Document Properties &gt; Page &gt; Custom Size.</em> You can create a grid, either rectangular or isometric, in <em>File &gt; Document Properties &gt; Grid</em>. You can start drawing with Bezier Curve tool [B], organize the drawing by layers...etc</p><p></p><h3 id="adding-text">Adding Text</h3><p>Text can be added in multiple ways using the Text tool [T]. You can simply add text, but that will get rendered with the image, resulting in any font/size you want. But I wanted the text to be rendered in LaTeX, such that it has uniform size and style, to match the rest of the document. For this, I type the text, with any required latex symbols as follows, and save a copy of the image as EPS+LaTeX. This creates an .eps file without text and a .tex file with text only. Make sure to keep the master copy of your drawing updated in the default SVG format (only save a copy in the EPS+TEX format) to avoid data loss.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/2021/11/11-1.png" width="606" height="704" loading="lazy" alt="My Paper-Writing Workflow [Inkscape, Python, Mendeley, VSCode, Git]" srcset="https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/11-1.png 600w, https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/2021/11/11-1.png 606w"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/2021/11/12.png" width="459" height="543" loading="lazy" alt="My Paper-Writing Workflow [Inkscape, Python, Mendeley, VSCode, Git]"></div></div></div><figcaption>(1) select the text, adjust the alignment.

Overleaf is great, but I hate web-based tools. I prefer something local, more responsive (thanks to my shitty connection) and with proper version control. Since I wrote the entire journal paper alone, all 15 pages of it, and revised it like ten times, I had the freedom to develop my own workflow. When I finally passed it on to my supervisor for final revision, I synced it with Overleaf so he can work with it comfortably and his changes will be reflected in my local machine. To compile LaTeX locally, you need a compiler like MiKTeX: <a href="https://miktex.org/">miktex.org</a>.</p><h3 id="vscode-latex-workshop">VSCode + Latex Workshop</h3><p>Maintained by Microsoft, yet free and open-source, VSCode <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">[get]</a> is the best editor/IDE out there for almost any language, hands-down.

Then I figured that it&apos;s what I have been missing all my life.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/2021/11/image-20.png" class="kg-image" alt="My Paper-Writing Workflow [Inkscape, Python, Mendeley, VSCode, Git]" loading="lazy" width="330" height="478"></figure><p>Git is a version control tool. Basically, a time machine that helps you to move to any point in the development, compare two points (diff), manage them collaboratively...etc. It guarantees that &quot;commits&quot; (aka snapshots) of your folder are immutable and non-deletable, giving you the confidence to clean up your code and try new things after each commit. &#xA0;</p><p>It has a horrible interface. The commands barely make sense. But underneath, it has a beautiful data model. Once I understood that deeply, I was able to recall or google commands at will and use git like a pro. Now I&apos;m addicted to the safety it provides. Even for a personal project, I start tracking it with git. Note, a git is a local tool. You don&apos;t need an internet connection to use it.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sjqTHE0zok?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>An awesome MIT video that explains git beautifully.

This allowed the Taliban to regroup and train in Pakistan easily. Khyber pass, an extremely strategic path through Hindu Kush mountains through which, Indo-Aryans, Genghis Khan, Persians, Mughals and British invaded India, was later used by American troops and Taliban to enter Afghanistan. &#x200B;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ab9zK8yT4_Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>Following British independence in 1919, the king tried to modernize the country by educating everyone (including women) and abolishing women&apos;s face veil. These liberal reforms led to a civil war with tribal leaders. After few more kings, in 1964 Afghanistan became more democratic, allowing multiple parties. One party (PDPA) took the power in a non-violent coup and started implementing communism, with the support of Soviet Russia.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>That &quot;democratic party&quot; banned forced marriages and promoted the education &amp; job security of women. They also tortured and killed local Muslim leaders and forced atheism. This and dependence on the Soviet Union angered the people. Islamist riots by Afghan Mujahedeen (armed tribal leaders) broke out. The Soviet Union invaded to quell the rebellion, killed millions and raped women. They systematically depopulated rural areas with landmines and even toy grenades targeted at children. In response, the US supplied anti-aircraft guns to Mujahedeen. After 9 years, in 1989, as USSR collapsed, the Soviets withdrew in defeat, much like the US does now. &#x200B;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Afghanistan"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">History of Afghanistan - Wikipedia</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description"></div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png" alt="Afghanistan: A Sad Story"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.</span><span class="kg-bookmark-publisher">Contributors to Wikimedia projects</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Shuja_Shah_Durrani_of_Afghanistan_in_1839.jpg" alt="Afghanistan: A Sad Story"></div></a></figure><p>People cheered, considering Mujahedeen as liberators.

They forbade women from leaving homes and studying. They committed at least 15 systematic massacres and genocides targeting the Shia and Hazara, torturing and killing 4000 at a time. Ahmed Shah Massoud, a respected tribal leader, railed up enough opposition, set up democratic institutions and promoted women rights. Taliban tried to bribe him by giving the Prime Minister position, but he declined and asked for a democratic solution. He addressed the EU in 2001, stating that the Taliban and Al Qaeda had introduced &quot;a very wrong perception of Islam&quot;. The Taliban assassinated him in 2001.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>On 11/9/2001, Afghan-based Al-Qaeda attacked the world trade centre. Taliban gave Osama Bin Laden safe harbour and in return US-led forces invaded Afghanistan. There isn&#x2019;t enough oil there though. In December 2001, the Taliban government was toppled. 77% of Afghan people supported the American invasion <a href="acsor-surveys.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Afghan-Futures-Wave-6-Analysis_FINAL-v2.pdf">[source 1]</a> <a href="https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/10127/Afghanistan_Jan06_art2.pdf">[source 2]</a>.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>NATO started building a government <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-middle-east-afghanistan-8d6d6d9e1e7cddbd49caf0b52a40c2e8">[source]</a>, training the Afghan army and police and implementing reforms. Women education rose from 0% to 60% (2016), free media and platforms for public debate were established. Infant mortality rates fell by half. In 2005, fewer than 1 in 4 Afghans had access to electricity. By 2019, nearly all did. The Afghan geography makes centralized control impossible. Most of the country being over 2000m in elevation makes the road networks non-existent. The US started rebuilding the Soviet-built circular highway with the help of the world bank, Saudi Arabia and Iran (wow), to unify the country. Then they got occupied with Iraq, Taliban strengthened themselves and started blowing up the highway and construction workers.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>Afghan society is geared more towards family and tribe than having a &#x201C;unified afghan&#x201D; feeling. The popular people who got Afghan govt positions were corrupt tribal warlords. In the leaked secret documents, the US military officials call Afghan soldiers &quot;incompetent fools and corrupt to the patrol level&#x201D; and blame themselves &#x201C;we moved too slowly initially when Taliban were defeated. When they rebounded, we trained too quickly&#x201D; (and quality fell) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/afghanistan-papers/afghanistan-war-confidential-documents/">[source]</a>. The US built an Afghan military that dwarfs the military of even developed countries. The US spent 20 years and 2 trillion dollars there, which mostly went to corrupt Afghan officers. 30% of the new police escaped with their weapons to put up their private checkpoints, becoming bandits, robbing people. The rural public lost trust in the centralized govt, police and military.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>Meanwhile, the Taliban regrouped in Pakistan and started attacking and controlling the strategic choke points. The US conducted war crimes, torture and killings of Taliban prisoners and suspects. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/07/06/how-us-funded-abuses-led-failure-afghanistan">The US killed 9 children in 2003 and 100 civilians (mostly children) in 2009</a>. This turned the international perception and rural Afghans against the US occupation. Of civilian casualties, 40% was due to the US &amp; Afghan govt and 60% was due to the Taliban. &#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>After Osama was killed in 2011, the occupation became unpopular among the US public. They didn&#x2019;t want their children being killed in an unrelated conflict. The US govt also did not have a clear objective after killing Osama. As a last attempt, Obama tried a &quot;surge&quot; of troop inflow, but the Taliban just surged their attacks. Obama started pulling out. Trump stroke a secret deal with the Taliban, without even consulting the Afghan govt they built, that the US would pull out by May 1st 2021. He reduced the 15,500 troops to 2,500. Biden says US succeeded in its objective: avenging 9/11 and making sure the region doesn&apos;t breed terrorism targeting mainland USA. Given Afghanistan is now a Taliban controlled terrorist state, US might have failed in that objective too.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>An exit strategy wasn&#x2019;t planned. When the Taliban attacked this year, with only 2500 US troops, Biden had to either send more resources and restart the war or stop the war by pulling out immediately, he decided on the latter <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-speech-transcript-on-afghanistan-taliban-takeover-august-16">[source]</a>. The US military shut off the lights in their airbase and slipped disgracefully without informing the Afghan army. The president fled the country betraying his people. The incompetent and corrupt Afghan govt and army collapsed like a house of cards and most of them switched sides to the Taliban for bribes.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>Now people are desperate to flee through the borders and Kabul airport, fearing the extremist rule, genocides and massacres of the Taliban. The US has a deal with the Taliban to continue the evacuation of allies and special visa Afghans. US &amp; French ambassadors fled, but the UK ambassador stays back writing visas for the Afghan translators, helping them escape. China quickly joined hands with the Taliban and India is shocked to have a terrorist country in its footsteps. The future of Afghanistan and its people is as uncertain as ever before.&#x200B;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/2021/11/236882220_10102988939664985_5938514270728019212_n.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Afghanistan: A Sad Story" loading="lazy" width="474" height="960"></figure><p>&#x200B;&#x200B;Disclaimer: I&apos;m no expert.

Even if the firmware is open-source, how do you verify it&apos;s the same code programmed into the machine? Even if it was compiled in front of your eyes, how do u know the compiler itself is safe?&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>GCC, the most popular C/C++ compiler itself is actually written in C. Then how is it compiled? Using older versions of itself! This fact was used by Ken Thompson, the legend who designed and implemented UNIX, the OS on which Linux (hence all android phones, data centers, mars rovers) and macOS (an overpriced piece of shit ;-) ) are built upon.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>When he wrote the &apos;login&apos; program of UNIX (during early days), he put a backdoor for debugging purposes. That is, given his secret password, any UNIX machine would unlock. But anyone else who reads the source code of login would notice this and panic. So, he hid that backdoor in the compiler, such that if the login program is compiled, it would insert the backdoor into the binary (assembly), else it would compile other programs normally. &#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>But, wouldn&apos;t people read compiler&apos;s source code? For that, he first built the backdoor in the compiler roughly as follows. If future compiler code is given to the compiler, it would generate a binary for a rigged compiler with the above back door. Else, it would compile other programs normally. &#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>He then compiled the compiler into binary and then removed the backdoor from the compiler&apos;s source code. Now the backdoor is practically invisible. it only exists as 1s and 0s in the binary. Anyone who reads the source code of the compiler sees it&apos;s perfectly fine. But when they add features to future versions of compiler code &amp; compile it with his rigged compiler, it generates a new, rigged compiler binary. When they compile the login source code with that rigged compiler in the future, it would place the back door into the login binary. &#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>Anyway, it was temporary, he never got caught and he revealed it when he received the Turing Award. However, this is an interesting phenomenon, and any kind of malware could be injected like this since we usually apt-get / download .exe of the compiler, which was in fact compiled by the older version of the same compiler.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>Btw, this is pretty common. Recently I heard from a podcast, that few years ago hackers infiltrated a company that makes network-security software. They injected their virus into their development toolchain. In the next release, that got into the software and was distributed to all their customers, who are big software companies and the US govt itself. It was found months later.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br><a href="https://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/04/15/strange-loops-dennis-ritchie-a">https://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/04/15/strange-loops-dennis-ritchie-a</a></p><p>First posted on Facebook: <a href="https://web.facebook.com/abarajithan11/posts/10223048594314768">facebook.com/abarajithan11/posts/10223048594314768</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Snowflake Generation:  A Defense]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>&quot;This is such a snowflake generation&quot; has been the mainstream conservative opinion for ages.

In every period of history, the elder generation has accused so. It is part of the &quot;during my time, we had to defeat a balrog to get to school&quot; mentality.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>This issue is similar to the memes about safety instructions. 50 years ago they didn&apos;t write &quot;do not drink&quot; on bleach bottles. Today we do. Does this mean we are dumber?&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>No. In any given population, there&apos;s a probability (say 0.001%) of people who are dumb enough to drink bleach. 50 years ago, they simply died. Today we have better consumer protection laws. If one guy dies, media erupts, companies get sued to bankruptcy. By simply making a minor change, which doesn&apos;t affect the lives of 99.999% of the population, we have drastically reduced the number/percentage of the dumb people who actually die. Is that bad?&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>Same with body shaming/sexual harassment...etc. There&apos;s always a percentage who are unable to handle it. I don&apos;t think that percentage is increasing. By spreading awareness, we are reducing the number/percentage of people who will mentally break down, grow up to be deeply scarred adults, or even commit suicide. It doesn&apos;t affect us personally, but we can bear a small inconvenience, to save a few lives. This is good, we should be proud.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>I&apos;m actually happy about this generation. We see kids being wholesome, having a common sense of what shouldn&apos;t be made fun of. A disabled kid, one with disfiguration is less likely to get bullied at school today. It was shocking to talk to mom and see what they have bullied about, during her time. She was unable to comprehend that we think differently and we don&apos;t even consider those funny. That&apos;s a win for our generation. We are improving. &#x200B; Our younger generation will be better than us.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>If you want to improve things further, teach your kids to stand up against injustice. Teach them to get into trouble in order to fearlessly defend themselves and the weak around them, regardless of the consequences. And when they do, tell them how proud you are. Teach them not to be blindly loyal to their morally corrupt friends. This is how we can build a resilient society that upholds justice.</p><p>First posted on Facebook: <a href="https://web.facebook.com/abarajithan11/posts/10222787695392458">facebook.com/abarajithan11/posts/10222787695392458</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tamil 101: For Non-Tamils​]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>TLDR: &#xA0;<em>Spoken Tamil dialects are just fancy ways of shortening written Tamil.

There is one unified written form, with well-defined grammar. But since the verb packs a ton of information as suffixes, which get shortened in spoken dialects, it might be hard to notice that pattern for beginners. Extracted from my convo with Kasun Withana. </em></p><hr><p>Tolkappiyam (literally old epic), written 2200 years ago, defines the grammar of Tamil as used today. The first verse goes like &quot;letters are 30. From a to na&quot;. So there goes the first misconception. Tamil doesn&apos;t have 248 letters. Only 30 prime ones. &#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>12 vowels, 18 consonants. &#x200B; The vowels are the ones in English (a,e,i,o,u) + their longer counterparts (5) + &apos;ai&apos; + &apos;ou&apos;. 6 extra consonants are borrowed from Sanskrit (although Tamil is from a different family) to get fancy sounds: sa, sha, ja, ha, ksha, shree. My name has one. There goes the second misconception. Tamil has fancy sounds.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>Third one: &apos;ae&apos;, &apos;aae&apos; vowels of Sinhala are also there. They are implicit, they arise naturally when compounding with some consonants. But f, z are not there.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>Unlike some other similarly ancient classical languages (Arabic, Chinese, Greek), the grammar of Tamil has not changed much or diverged into varieties in 2200 years. However, the alphabet has changed. Started as Tamil Brahmi (Brahmi was the common script in India), it changed gradually. After a massive reform in 1978, the letters and their combinations are very consistent now.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>The spoken dialects are based on written Tamil, whose verbs are a bit complicated. Tamil is an agglutinative language. Unlike spoken Sinhala and English, the tense (past/present/future), sex (male/female/non-conscious), voice (active/passive), number (singular/plural) are all added as suffixes to the verb. This follows a well-defined order and set of rules, and unlike English, exceptions are extremely rare. &#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>For example:&#x200B;</p><blockquote>avan saappitt-aan = he ate&#x200B;<br>avan saappittu-vitt-aan = he has eaten&#x200B;<br>avan saappitt-irupp-aan = he would have eaten&#x200B;<br>avan saappittu-kkond-irunth-irupp-aan = he would have been eating&#x200B;<br>avan saappittu-kkond-irunth-irukka-maattaan = he would not have been eating&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br></blockquote><p>Breaking the verb:&#x200B;</p><blockquote>saappidu = eat (base verb - command)&#x200B;<br>-vittu- = perfect&#x200B;<br>iru = would&#x200B;<br>ttaan = male, past&#x200B;</blockquote><p>Fun fact: The word &quot;&#xB9A;&#xBC6;&#xBB2;&#xBCD;&#xBB2;&#xBBE;&#xBA4;&#xBBF;&#xBB0;&#xBC1;&#xBAA;&#xBCD;&#xBAA;&#xBB5;&#xBB0;&#xBCD;&quot; (cellaathiruppavar) is ranked 8th in The Most Untranslatable Word In The World. &#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>The pattern of suffixes is hard to notice from spoken dialects. Tamil is harder to speak than Sinhala, precisely due to this. Spoken dialects are simply different ways of shortening written Tamil. Jaffna Tamil, SL Muslim Tamil, Kotahena slang, Madras tamil... Tamil Nadu must have hundreds of dialects. If you speak the common written form, you&apos;ll sound like a newsreader or like a modern poet. But it will be intelligible and people will love you for the effort.</p><blockquote>Irukkinraaya? - Written = Are (you) there?&#x200B;<br>irukkiya? - Indian / sms&#x200B;<br>irukkiriya? - Jaffna&#x200B;<br>eekkiyaa? - Muslim&#x200B; (Akurana)</blockquote><p>Madras Tamil is fun. It&apos;s the most optimized form of Tamil. They condense so much information into so few syllables. &#x200B;</p><blockquote>Iluthuththuk kondu po = pull this and go (take it away)&#x200B;<br>isthukinupo - Madras Tamil&#x200B;</blockquote><p>So, yeah... If you would like to learn spoken Tamil, you don&apos;t need to learn the written one. But it helps to know that seemingly arbitrary changes in verbs come from well-defined grammatical rules of written Tamil. You can find a youtube tutorial video of a cute girl and learn to speak from there &#x1F609;.</p><p>First posted on Facebook: <a href="https://web.facebook.com/abarajithan11/posts/10222627017895621">facebook.com/abarajithan11/posts/10222627017895621</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[English Skills: Pride & Prejudice]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Learning English is not about pride, it&apos;s just another language.

I learnt it out of necessity since I was too shy to speak in Sinhala from Grade 7-ALs. But as an international language, English brings a lot of opportunities to get exposure.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>By the way, being fluent in English doesn&apos;t mean you have to let go of your first language. In my experience, my bilingual friends (and I) read a lot in both languages, watch good cinema in both languages and have an excellent grasp of the grammar and vocabulary of their native language as well. If your kid grows up speaking English only, the fault is yours, not of the kid or English. &#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>To add to the list, you get to learn that:&#x200B;&#x200B;</p><ul><li>Romans had complex cities and an empire spanning Europe with drainage systems when Vijaya was landing in Sri Lanka (6th century BC). They even kept records of what happened in their courts from that time.&#x200B;&#x200B;</li><li>Roman roads, designed as multi-layered, built in 300 BC are still being used. Around that time, Byzantium had multi-story apartment complexes which were rented.&#x200B;&#x200B;</li><li>When Aryans were settling in Ganges valley (3000-4000 BC), Egypt and Indus valley had complex civilizations that were trading over the ocean. Egypt, Assyria and all had houses well planned and built for average citizens. </li></ul><p>So yeah, Sri Lanka is neither the oldest nor the greatest civilization in the world. But we have a rich history of multiple cultures. We need to preserve that and do actual historical research, rather than boasting about legends. Meanwhile, we can appreciate other cultures and civilizations that are similarly great as well.</p><p>First posted on Facebook: <a href="https://web.facebook.com/abarajithan11/posts/10222599976619606">facebook.com/abarajithan11/posts/10222599976619606</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Webinars: Modern C++ & Embedded]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Following the success of SystemVerilog session, my friend and fellow junior lecturer Kithmin and few others got together to organize another Missing Semester series, for ROS.

Several from my family. Usually boys of age around 20-25. They get in as refugees, work and send money home here. &#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>So, in their 28-30, when they settle and get refugee PR, they have gotta get married, right? You cant move easily back and forth. And tickets are expensive. So the standard procedure was this:&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>The family of the boy will find a girl of the same caste and good horoscope. Often, the boy doesn&apos;t even get to look at her picture. They arrange the marriage here. During the reception, the boy&apos;s mom wears the ring to the girl and forges her son&apos;s signature. Marriage is done! They send the girl abroad to live happily ever after with the boy, mostly on a fake passport / as a PR wife. &#x200B;</p><h3 id="this-was-a-widespread-practice-now-the-best-part">This was a widespread practice. Now, the best part</h3><p>Remember, these girls have never talked to their guys, probably never talked to any guy. Now, they have a lot of money and jewelry packed and are terrified of living alone abroad. So, naturally, many of them elope on the way. I mean, prior to the flight, they stay at a hotel in Colombo (with a family member), &#xA0;right? They run with the charming hotel guy. Which was also quite common.&#x200B;</p><p>So, when my uncle (mom&apos;s 2nd cousin, Canada) was at the right age, he told my mom:</p><blockquote>&quot;You find a girl for me. I don&apos;t even want to see her. But don&apos;t send her like this. I&apos;ll come there, marry her and take her here. Else she might run away with someone on the way&quot;&#x200B;</blockquote><h3 id="okay-what-is-jam-fruit-tree">Okay, what is Jam Fruit Tree?</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://aba-blog.xyz/the-jam-fruit-tree-book-review/index.html"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">The Jam Fruit Tree - Book Review</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">One of the best novels I&#x2019;ve read in English!

Read on for some ExplainLikeImFive...&#x200B;</p><h3 id="why-computer-vision%E2%80%8B">Why computer vision?&#x200B;</h3><p>Perseverance, the $2.7 billion, SUV sized rover that autonomously landed on Mars today does a lot of cool stuff. Since it takes over 5 minutes for signals to reach Mars, they cannot control it like flying an RC drone. Unlike previous rovers, this time the landing algorithm autonomously matched the images of the landing site for precise landing.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>Also, the rover is able to drive around by autonomously planning the path using CV algorithms and by processing other data. This makes it the fastest rover ever. With about 200m a day average speed.&#x200B;</p><h3 id="why-fpgas%E2%80%8B">Why FPGAs?&#x200B;</h3><p>Images are a bunch of large matrices. Computer vision is basically doing millions of repetitive calculations on them, to finally detect objects...etc. With normal CPUs with few big cores, this will take forever. So, we use GPUs, which have hundreds of tiny, dumb cores. But GPUs are power-hungry (gaming PCs serve a dual purpose as room heaters).&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>Edge systems, like Mars rovers, are limited in power. So, RTL designers design custom digital circuits (verilog) to create hundreds of custom cores to parallelize their computations. Since we can optimize the cores to our particular need, the power consumption is super low. &#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>If you have enough demand, you can fabricate chips (ASIC) from these. When u make millions of chips (like those u put in mobile / computer), the per-chip price comes down to few dollars - super cheap. But since you don&apos;t make a million mars rovers, they put the custom circuit in a pre-built, reconfigurable canvas: an FPGA.<br>&#x200B;<br>Unlike Curiosity, Perseverance has a few Xilinx-made Virtex 5 FPGAs to perform all the CV needed for autonomous landing and self-driving. They can use the same chip to now do RGB images optimally, then change the circuit inside and do 3D images optimally. I&apos;m glad to see this field is booming.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>Hardcore info: <a href="https://www.fierceelectronics.com/electronics/nasa-mars-rover-perseverance-launches-thursday-to-find-evidence-life-red-planet?fbclid=IwAR32GQkm1smKsisFtgK1ia9cgoybw8rUmjn9sUjUDqiix1u9P8VJ7pHWEr0">fierceelectronics.com/electronics/nasa-mars-rover-perseverance-launches-thursday-to-find-evidence-life-red-planet</a></p><p>First posted on Facebook: <a href="https://web.facebook.com/abarajithan11/posts/10221852292447969">facebook.com/abarajithan11/posts/10221852292447969</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My Patriotism - Happy Independence Day]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I usually come under fire for criticizing the faults in the government, politics, society and culture of Sri Lanka as &quot;You never see the good side, you are never proud of your country, you think other countries are better&quot;.

Particles are stuff that is each governed by a fundamental &apos;wavefunction&apos;. The wavefunction is THE most fundamental thing. It&apos;s not just another property of a particle. It&apos;s THE particle.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>The wavefunction of a particle is defined by Schrodinger&#x2019;s complex-valued wave equation. Fun fact: time independent form is just a simple harmonic equation. Properties of the given particle such as momentum, position and all are just different &apos;views&apos; of this wavefunction.</p><p>Btw, we cannot measure the wavefunction directly. It&apos;s always behind the scenes. We can only measure the &apos;observables&apos;. Observables are position, momentum...etc. and are &apos;views&apos; of the wavefunction. We get the position &apos;distribution&apos; of the particle by applying the position &apos;operator&apos; on the wavefunction.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>Distribution? Yes. These observables (position, momentum) are not numbers. They are always probability distributions over all possible values. We need to wrap our heads around the fact that the nature of reality is probabilistic on the fundamental level. It&#x2019;s not like we are unable to build a device to measure a particle&#x2019;s position. The particle actually doesn&#x2019;t have a &apos;position&apos;.&#x200B;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLR2M2HnBKl3OKHZUUFSYbbBMLAnKIKTtX" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>Here is an animation to show how wavefunction behaves, to explain the wave-particle duality and fringe pattern without resorting to &quot;consciousness&quot;</figcaption></figure><p>Here comes the fun part. Position and momentum operators are Fourier transform pairs of each other. Just like time and frequency. &#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>A quick recap on the Fourier domain. Time and Frequency are Fourier transform pairs. In a given song, if you want to find where (time) a specific frequency comes up, you cut the song into tiny intervals and take the Short Term Fourier Transform. Then we would lose the precision on frequency. In a spectrogram (frequency-time plot of a song), as you finely sample the time axis, the frequency axis gets fuzzier. And vice versa. It is impossible to find both frequency and the time where it occurs with high accuracy.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>The same thing happens with position and momentum Fourier pairs. Firstly, we cannot measure/observe a property of a particle, without interacting with the particle. When two particles interact, their wavefunctions interact and modify each other. If we set up a detector to &apos;read&apos; the position, that is if we set up stuff that interacts with the wavefunction to make it&apos;s position distribution sharper, the momentum distribution automatically becomes fuzzier.<br>&#x200B;<br>&#x394;x&#xB7;&#x394;p &#x2265; h/4&#x3C0;&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>Heisenberg&#x2019;s uncertainty principle follows this. The product of the error in position measurement (&#x394;x) and momentum measurement (&#x394;p) is always bigger than a known constant. Because the position and momentum don&#x2019;t exist for a particle with arbitrary accuracy. This is the mathematical nature of reality. Comes from the fact that those operators are a Fourier transform pair.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>Ok, from this we can look at wavefunction collapse.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>Wavefunction never &apos;collapses&apos;. Say, we set up a detector to read position. That detector does it by interacting with the particle, modifying its wavefunction to make the position distribution &apos;view&apos; sharper (uncertainty in that &apos;view&apos; is reduced). That will never be 100% sharp as a point. Means, we can never know the exact location of the particle. Because it doesn&apos;t actually have a position.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>This is what we call &apos;it behaves as a particle&apos;. In reality, it doesn&apos;t behave as anything. It is what it is. The wavefunction has not &apos;collapsed&apos;. Instead, by making one &apos;view&apos; of the wavefunction sharper, we have made the other view (momentum) fuzzier. The wavefunction is still there it&apos;s full majestic form. If that particle goes on to interact with another detector which now tries to measure momentum (modify the wavefunction to make momentum &apos;view&apos; sharper), the position gets fuzzier.&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>This is what happens in the double-slit experiment as well. Since it is an experiment focused on reading the position &apos;view&apos;, we don&apos;t talk about momentum. Which is why we loosely say things like &#x201C;wavefunction collapses at the detector&#x201D; and &#x201C;electron behaves as a particle when measured&#x201D;. However, in our attempt at trying to read the position by making position &apos;view&apos; sharper (more particle-like), we have just made the momentum &apos;view&apos; of the same particle fuzzier (more wave-like).&#x200B;<br>&#x200B;<br>Isn&apos;t it fascinating to know that &apos;imaginary&apos; numbers and Fourier transform are at the foundations of reality itself?&#x200B;</p><hr><p>My exposure to hardcore QM is a basic module and an assignment on numerically solving the Schrodinger equation in 1D, 2D, and 3D.

Interestingly, the electron doesn&apos;t have a position, but only has a probability distribution over space, which is found by solving the Schrodinger Equation in 1D.</p><p>That distribution is a set of 1D waves in space, the fundamental frequency, first overtone, second overtone...etc based on the gap between two barriers, as shown above. If the electron is given the energy 0.03 eV, it will be like the bottom one (fundamental frequency). The electron will have a higher probability of existence at the center.</p><p>If it&apos;s given energy of about 0.5 eV, it will have the probability distribution that looks like the first overtone. That is, there is very little probability of the electron existing at the center. </p><p>Note how the electron can only take discrete energy values. You can&apos;t just give 0.25 eV of energy. The electron will not accept that. So, we say energy is &quot;quantized&quot;. That gives the name quantum mechanics.</p><p>Generalizing for any case, if you know the potential (voltage) field of the space, charge, and mass of the particle, you can find a function called the Hamiltonian. Its eigenvalues are the possible values of energy that the electron can take. Its corresponding eigenfunctions are the wavefunctions of the particle. The norm square of the wavefunction will be the probability. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/2022/01/direct_2D_wav-eps-converted-to.png" class="kg-image" alt="Making Sense of Quantum Mechanics&#x200B;" loading="lazy" width="1772" height="1000" srcset="https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/size/w600/2022/01/direct_2D_wav-eps-converted-to.png 600w, https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/size/w1000/2022/01/direct_2D_wav-eps-converted-to.png 1000w, https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/size/w1600/2022/01/direct_2D_wav-eps-converted-to.png 1600w, https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/2022/01/direct_2D_wav-eps-converted-to.png 1772w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>When you solve this numerically (when u cut the space into a grid), everything becomes matrices.

Several streams of interest: telecommunications, robotics, electronics...etc. were being revised and overhauled to provide a more coherent and effective learning experience for our students.</p><h3 id="my-other-initiatives">My other initiatives</h3><p>During this time, I pioneered several hands-on workshops to the students of our department and general public, to boost their productivity and to interactively test the theoretical knowledge they gain in lectures. Missing Semester (MS) series, which I independently started with my <a href="https://aba-blog.xyz/systemverilog-2020/index.html">MS1: SystemVerilog</a> sessions, gained traction, leading to senior staff and fellow junior staff conducting more programs: MS2: ROS for Robotics and <a href="https://aba-blog.xyz/embedded-2021/index.html">MS3: Embedded Systems</a> (for which I also contributed).</p><p>I also introduced version control with git to final year students through seminars. On the one hand, git is an invaluable tool to users (students) that acts as a time machine, allowing them to reliably move to any immutable past / parallel snapshot, allowing them to manage the complexity of their projects. On the other hand, the well documented and immutable development history provided by git allows the managers (teachers) to keep track of each member&apos;s contribution with timestamps and the change they made.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sjqTHE0zok?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>The MIT missing semester session that taught me git and inspired me to pioneer our MS program</figcaption></figure><h3 id="module-design">Module design</h3><p>One key issue addressed in the curriculum revision meetings was, that many of our students are not familiar with the industry best practices when it comes to programming. Skills such as writing readable code, appropriate use of OOP, managing project complexity were not developed well enough through our electronics-oriented curriculum. As a result, most students who go for software and firmware development face a disadvantage.</p><p>In this setting, I was approached by Dr. Ranga, the Head of our Department to design a module to address this issue. With a tight deadline, I designed a rough curriculum based on my knowledge, shared it with our past students in the industry, collected feedback and finalized it. Dr. Ranga made appropriate modifications and added it to the formal curriculum of the department, assigning me as the lecturer in charge. It was named <em>Software Design Competition</em> to satisfy the count of competition modules.</p><h3 id="summary">Summary</h3><p>To summarize, it is a hands-on course with 100% CA. Students choose one of the two given projects (or propose their own project), design a solution through appropriate use of OOP, start development while version controlling collaboratively, write appropriate unit &amp; integration tests and proper documentation as they finish the project. Quality of code and documentation of the development history are evaluated via periodic code reviews conducted by industry professionals.</p><p>The curriculum with the module has been approved by the University Grants Commission (UGC), Sri Lanka. I shared the final draft with the past students who commended it as something they desperately needed in their time as an undergraduate. With other modules designed by experienced senior staff, I believe the new curriculum of the leading department in the leading technological university is about to be a gamechanger for the industry and the future of Sri Lanka.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Visual Guide to DSP - Teaching Assistance]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Around December 2020, I was assigned as a TA for the sophomore level module Digital Signal Processing and was tasked with helping them solve some tutorial questions. </p><p>During my time as a student, I felt lost in this module and got a grade of B+.

They approach HDLs with the software programming mindset. In addition, our program does not teach an HDL explicitly but expects students to pick up from Verilog basics and learn as they go. As a result, many are unaware of the advanced features of SystemVerilog that makes their lives easy by reducing bugs and saving time.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/2021/11/Slide35.PNG" class="kg-image" alt="Webinars: Design and Simulation with SystemVerilog" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/Slide35.PNG 600w, https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/Slide35.PNG 1000w, https://aba-blog.xyz/content/images/2021/11/Slide35.PNG 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Examples, topics and features covered</figcaption></figure><p>During my undergraduate project, I used SystemVerilog for features such as multidimensional ports.

Thank you so much for sharing those details with me. I loved your first and second sessions. But couldn&apos;t join for the third one due to my busy schedule. I enjoyed the session on system verilog you conducted today very much. Is it possible to share a list containing the books and videos I can read and watch to learn system verilog from the scratch? Thank you for the session again. It was pretty awesome and interesting. </blockquote><blockquote>What I feel is that this session was the cream of the HDL extracted from internet and every references. If you can do this kind of dedications, it would really helpful for the new comers to the field. Thank you vary much aiya and all the best for your future works! &lt;3</blockquote><blockquote>This was very good. I had almost 0 experience in this, just the semester 3 practical. As a beginner I leant a lot. Thank you very much. The speed was alright, almost nothing to complain about. Thank you once again.</blockquote><blockquote>I loved the session. It was amazing how the session covered a lot of content within such a short period of time while concentrating on the basics as well. Thank you for such a helpful session. In the session, the presenter asked us to write code before explaining the code. It will be better if the code was explained a bit before at least what the code does in chunks and asked us to write the code, it will be better. I would like to know proper resources where we can refer with respect to SystemVerilog, so that whenever we have a knowledge gap we will know where to refer to.</blockquote><blockquote>The session was excellent. I have done digital circuit designs using Verilog before. But, I did not have a clear understanding on most of the stuff. Today, I could understand many of them with your step by step explanations. Thanks a lot for that. The method of delivery was fine to me. Definitely I will join for the next sessions as well. Thank you again for conducting such a fruitful session.</blockquote><blockquote>I&apos;m an NDES diploma holder from IET Katunayaka. This field is only heard by me during our training sessions and never been taught to us during our academic sessions. This lecture series is very valuable for us and thank you very much for open knowledge sharing and providing recorded zoom videos. Your teaching style is very attractive and not boring. I wish you all the best and hope you will continue to share your valuable knowledge with the local technologically curious audience. Please make sure to give more publicity to theses sessions since I got the email only from a good friend of mine.</blockquote><blockquote>excellent session. nice visuals. clear explanations. speed was adequate so that students can grasp the idea. looking forward for advanced stuff. thank you</blockquote><blockquote>session 4 was very interesting with the matrix multiplication part. It would be very useful if you can add more applications if possible. Thank you for your time for doing all these useful sessions and hope to see more of these in future.</blockquote><blockquote>Sessions series was really helpful and I think, it made it easy to go deeper into the system Verilog HDL since now we know what are the limitations and capabilities of the language. It would be better if the speaker can go more slowly. As it is really difficult to move between zoom and the application software when he is explaining things. Giving some time after explanation to make things clear will be better and more productive.</blockquote><blockquote>Nothing big to complain. Never felt other sessions like these, this much interactive and useful. Thank you for all your effort</blockquote><blockquote>3rd session also was very much informative and anyone with a basic knowledge could follow. It was bit fast but was manageable as I have some prior experience with verilog coding. You covered a big area with that limited time and keep it going for more sessions in the future for other key topics as well. Thanks</blockquote><blockquote>The Session was okay, some of them were very advance, but it is interesting to learn. Thank you for doing this.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you very much sir once again. I learnt a lot today and could get the answers for many problems that I had up to now. Thanks once again...!!!</blockquote><blockquote>The session was comprehensive and clear. Within the time constraint, a better insight to the subject is provided. Thank you for your hard work.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you very much sir. This is extremely helpful for me. I have met some of these issues that you spoke about today and didn&apos;t know how to overcome those ones and now I understand how to solve those problems. Thank you very much once again...!!!</blockquote><blockquote>fruitful session. nice visuals. thank you so much. My suggestion is it is better to have the final project in a separate session. I guess there will be a lot to cover. this is the adequate speed to maintain. definitely, we may not be able to cover the last 3 in 2 hours. thank you</blockquote><blockquote>good explanation and you answered our questions clearly. appreciate it</blockquote><blockquote>Very much informative, clear and interactive. Appreciate your sharp and broad knowledge on the subject</blockquote><blockquote>Hopeful for more sessions like this in future too</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you for conducting this session. It was really helpful in understanding the basics of digital designs.</blockquote><blockquote>The session was really really good. This makes to get into academic projects very easy. The pace of the session was also good. I would like to know more about vivado and systemverilog that will help me to do advanced projects. Hope you cover much much more in coming sessions. If possible it would be great to cover industrial aspects as well while designing and implementing.</blockquote><blockquote>one kindly request sir....only if you can, keep the sessions like this further with the whole ENTC junior staff, because these are very useful</blockquote><blockquote>Good work Anna... Our department can use this quarantine time to this kind of activities. ENTC can support more for this kind of tutorials. For a geek like me , It is very helpful. I have to spend a lot of time in finding good tutorials. Don&apos;t stop with 3 sessions. Expecting more Anna.</blockquote><blockquote>Nice interaction. Helped me to recall what I leaned in digital IC designing.</blockquote><blockquote>Well done mlli!!! Superb! nd thnx a lot for ur generous service!You had worked hard on it! You must be full contented abt ur effort mlli!!!it was truly amazing</blockquote><p></p><h2 id="code">Code</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/abarajithan11/entc_missing_semester/tree/master/systemverilog">github.com/abarajithan11/entc_missing_semester/tree/master/systemverilog</a></p><h2 id="video-recordings">Video Recordings</h2><p>First video was downloaded 2279 times (and counting)</p><p>Download: <a href="https://dms.uom.lk/s/VMVBDESqhc7ByZv">dms.uom.lk/s/VMVBDESqhc7ByZv</a></p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ol><li><strong>RTL Modeling with SystemVerilog for Simulation and Synthesis: Using SystemVerilog for ASIC and FPGA Design</strong> by Stuart Sutherland&#x200B;<br>Primary reference material I used for the slides.
